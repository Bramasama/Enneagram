      <p><strong>The Enneagram is an archetypal framework that offers in-depth insight to individuals, groups and collectives. Consisting of three Centers of intelligence, nine main Enneagram types, 18 wings, three subtypes and Triadic styles, the Enneagram offers a rich map to personal development from an open systems perspective. It does not box in people, but rather opens a pathway to self-discovery and greater personal awareness.</strong>

The Integrative Enneagram creates self-awareness and uncovers the patterns of behavior that sub-consciously drive and motivate us to act in certain ways. When we make these patterns and motivations conscious, we are able to transcend them and develop richer, more supportive ways of being. Working with the Enneagram empowers individuals to take responsibility for their own behaviors and growth, from a greater understanding of why they act and react the way they do.

As a framework, the Enneagram also speaks to the journey of integration and development in a profound way. It is able to uncover the uniqueness of each individual and his/her journey. It does not only reveal what holds an individual back, but also offers insights into the journey towards strength and liberation, connecting us to our strengths and higher selves.

The Enneagram is, therefore, a sense-making tool or a framework that enables the development of self-knowledge and meta-awareness.</p>
